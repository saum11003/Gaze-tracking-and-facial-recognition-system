Gaze tracking and facial recognition-based systems enable use cases such as proctoring. It has been implemented using Open CV AND facial recognition is applied using dlib library. Once the face is recognised it is annotated with the person's name and coordinates of pupil movement are mentioned along with which direction they are looking into.
